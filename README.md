## Project Description
Welcome to the Coffee House project! This project demonstrates the development of a responsive, interactive coffee shop website. The Coffee House website includes a "Home" page and a "Menu" page, each designed to provide a seamless user experience across various devices, ranging from desktops to mobile phones.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, adapting smoothly from desktop (1440px) to mobile (380px) views.
- **Semantic HTML:** The project adheres to semantic HTML practices, ensuring the content is well-structured and accessible.
- **Interactivity with JavaScript:** Interactive elements enhance user engagement and functionality, providing a dynamic browsing experience.

## Project Structure
The Coffee House project is divided into three key stages:

1. **Week 1: Fixed Layout**

    - Created static "Home" and "Menu" pages based on a Figma design, optimized for a window width of at least 1440px.
2. **Week 2: Responsive Design**

     - Added responsiveness to the "Home" and "Menu" pages, ensuring proper display down to a window width of 380px, with no horizontal scroll bars.
3. **Week 3: Adding Functionality**

     - Implemented JavaScript to add interactivity, enhancing user engagement with the website.

## Pages Overview

- **Home Page:** Welcomes visitors to the Coffee House, providing an overview of offerings and atmosphere.
- **Menu Page:** Displays the available coffee and snack options with detailed descriptions.
